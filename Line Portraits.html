    <p>For this assignment I just took a quick photo of myself through the photo booth and used that to trace during class in the app photoshop. And I used my first name for my background text because it's my name with my self portrait, so why not add my name in the background. Plus I like the way it came out and added a background color that would match the text color so i combined red and pink. I also chose these colors because they are some of my favorite colors. And it looks good, The tracing was very basic which represents me because I am very basic and like basic things. I feel like creating it the way I feel would show a bit of me within my artwork.</p>
