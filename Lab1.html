<h1> Section 1: This Is My First Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph. Notice how the text above is displayed in a larger size; that's because itâ€™s a heading, while this sentence is written as a paragraph, which is the default text size. </p>
<br>
<h2> Section 2: My Second Heading </h2>
   <p>This can continue endlessly. Also, notice how each heading becomes smaller in size as you move down the levels of headings. For example, H1, H2, H3. </p>
   <br>
   <h3> Section 3: My Thrid Heading </h3>
   <p> Notice how I have added spacing after each section. This is done using a line break (br), which creates extra space between elements. </p>
