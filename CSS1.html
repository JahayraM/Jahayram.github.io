<h2> All About Bats </h2>

<h3>What are bats? What do they do?</h3>

<p> Bats are mammals of the order Chiroptera.[a] With their forelimbs adapted as wings, they are the only mammals capable of true and sustained flight. Bats are more manoeuvrable than birds, flying with their very long spread-out digits covered with a thin membrane or patagium. The smallest bat, and arguably the smallest extant mammal, is Kitti's hog-nosed bat, which is 29–34 millimetres (1 1⁄8–1 3⁄8 inches) in length, 150 mm (6 in) across the wings and 2–2.6 g (1⁄16–3⁄32 oz) in mass. The largest bats are the flying foxes and the giant golden-crowned flying fox, Acerodon jubatus, which can weigh 1.6 kg (3 1⁄2 lb) and have a wingspan of 1.7 m (5 ft 7 in). </p>
<p> The second largest order of mammals after rodents, bats comprise about 20% of all classified mammal species worldwide, with over 1,400 species. These were traditionally divided into two suborders: the largely fruit-eating megabats, and the echolocating microbats. But more recent evidence has supported dividing the order into Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera, with megabats as members of the former along with several species of microbats. Many bats are insectivores, and most of the rest are frugivores (fruit-eaters) or nectarivores (nectar-eaters). A few species feed on animals other than insects; for example, the vampire bats feed on blood. Most bats are nocturnal, and many roost in caves or other refuges; it is uncertain whether bats have these behaviours to escape predators. Bats are present throughout the world, with the exception of extremely cold regions. They are important in their ecosystems for pollinating flowers and dispersing seeds; many tropical plants depend entirely on bats for these services.</p>
<h4>Are bats bad for us? What do they represent?<h4>
<p> Bats provide humans with some direct benefits, at the cost of some disadvantages. On the benefits side, bat dung has been and in many places still is mined as guano from caves and used as fertiliser. Bats consume insect pests, reducing the need for pesticides and other insect management measures. They are sometimes numerous enough and close enough to human settlements to serve as tourist attractions, and they are used as food across Asia and the Pacific Rim. On the disadvantages side, fruit bats are frequently considered pests by fruit growers. Due to their physiology, bats are one type of animal that acts as a natural reservoir of many pathogens, such as rabies; and since they are highly mobile, social, and long-lived, they can readily spread disease among themselves. If humans interact with bats, these traits become potentially dangerous to humans.</p>
<h5>Why are bats bad or good to have?</h5>
<p> Bats are an important part of our ecosystem, but they are wild animals and can carry rabies, so never touch a bat!  While bats most commonly roost in buildings, trees and caves they have been known to roost in less common areas such as under picnic tables and under umbrellas left in the outdoors.  Bats hiss and make screeching sounds as a defense mechanism if they feel threatened.  And although the majority of bats can take flight from the ground a few species of bats have difficulties and people often mistake this behavior as being ill or rabid.  You cannot tell if a bat has rabies by looking at it.  If you see a bat in a building, showing signs of unusual behavior, or if you wake up in the room with a bat it is imperative that you contact proper authorities for safe capture and possible testing.  Proper authorities are your local police department or your county public health department.  If you are renting, contact your landlord so that they are informed and can take proper action. </p>
<p> Bats can transmit rabies to humans and animals. Though rabies deaths are uncommon in the United States, it is one of the world’s most deadly diseases impacting 5 billion people annually and resulting in as many as 70,000 human deaths worldwide each year.</p>
<p> Transmission of rabies from animals to humans primarily occurs from a bite of an infected animal through the saliva.  Although additional routes of transmission from animals to humans occur they are rare. While all mammals can contract and spread rabies, in the U. S. rabies is primarily carried by skunks, bats, raccoons, foxes and coyotes.  The primary source of human deaths from rabies in the U. S. is from bats.</p>
