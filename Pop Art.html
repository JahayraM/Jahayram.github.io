  <p>I chose this particular portrait and this particular celebrity because they are one of my favorite celebrities. Her name is Selena Gomez and she is an American singer, actress, and producer. Born and raised in Texas, Gomez began her acting career on the children's television series Barney & Friends. From there her career started growing. I mainly chose this celebrity portrait as my subject matter because she's gone through a lot and is a sweet person that I grew up watching in disney.
The colors I used to make my work pop were very random because I used colors that I liked and thought would match each other. I like how it turned out because it is very colorful and bright. It was a bit difficult to create this because I am not a pro on using the Dreamweaver app. We had to constantly duplicate the layer and change the colors.</p>
