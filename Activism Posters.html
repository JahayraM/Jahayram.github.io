 <p> I really like the way this poster came out because it helps bring awareness to a real life problem. I also feel like it can add a bit of my creativity, it might be basic but I feel like it will and can catch other people's attention. And I used images that demonstrates the BLM movement and match the color with the back ground to hand.</p>
