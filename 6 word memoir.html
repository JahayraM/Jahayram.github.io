  <p>For this assignment I had to cut out images that would represent me or somethings I like from magazines. Then I would paste it into a page and kind of put it where ever we would like it. This assignment has helped ,e be more creative and show things I like through the images I used. For example I used the image for the city because I live in a city and glued out my name with different fonts from different magazine titles. And cut out two of my favorite colors that I like.</p>
