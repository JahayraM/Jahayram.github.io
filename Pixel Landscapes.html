 <p> I want to express my feeling of nature and what I like, which is a beautiful open nature landscape. I chose this landscape to recreate, because I liked it and thought it would look better with a sunset as a background. While drawing I thought of peace and natureâ€™s beauty while working on my art. For this Assignment it took a lot of work because I had to draw it out and detail it pixel by pixel which was very hard since I don't have a very steady hand. I also did it with a laptop which made it much worse because we don't have a computer mouse. It would have made it easier for me.</p>
