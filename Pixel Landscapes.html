 <p> This Assignment took a lot of work. This is because I had to drw it out and detail it pixel by pixel which was very hard since I don't have a very steady hand. For this assignment I did it with a laptop which made it much worse because we don't have a computer mouse. It would have made it easier for me.</p>
