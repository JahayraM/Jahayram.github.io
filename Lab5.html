<p> We all have heard either the story, song, or movie of rudolph with the red nosed reindeer. Well those who dont know, Robert L. May. created this character. And Johnny Marks created the origonal music of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer". The story of Rudolph started off with his characteristics. Rudolph was abnormally large, shiny, and had a red nose. He was constantly teased by the other black-nosed reindeer. Rudolph was very upset and hated his nose. But on a foggy Christmas Eve, Santa realizes Rudolph's glowing snout is what he needs so that he can deliver presents to children on time. Ever since that day he has learned to love himself even though he is different and every raindeer respected him as leader. Rudolph basically saved christmas!
