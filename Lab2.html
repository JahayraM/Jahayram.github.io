	<a href = "DigitalDesign.html">Digital Design Page&nbsp;&nbsp;</a> <br>
    <p>Hi my name is jahayra, I go to beca.I live in the bronx and I like the color light blue.I'm from Ecuador and somethings I like is soccer, food, my phone, outdoors, I love sunsets, beautiful views and shopping. I also like to be with the family and go out to places. For example, like this summer I went to camping with family members and some close friends(it was fun). We got to see wild animals like a baby bear and deers roaming around the camp site(scary)luckily the police park where there and escorded the baby bear away. We got to hang out in the beach, and barbeque all day.Somethings I dislike is staying home all day(boring), rude people, and raining days.My star sign is a capricorn, I tend to be shy when meeting new people but people who knows me knows how clumsy, funny, kind, respectful person I am.  </p>

  <h3> Fun Facts </h3>
   <p>I have 5 memebers in my family my dad, mom, 2 sisters and me. My dad and mom are both from Ecuador and my 2 sisters and I were born here. Which makes us Ecuadorian and American. One of my sister is a todler she's 1 year old almost 2 (yay!) and the other one is 10 years old. I am the oldest which sucks because I have to look after them every day. I hate baby sitting the middle one her name is sheyla she always likes me to get annoyed. She's a real pain but the little one, she loves me more than sheyla. Sheyla bothers her a lot and she doesn't like that. Her name is sasha me and her get along so well :)   </p>
