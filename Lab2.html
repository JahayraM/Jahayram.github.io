  <h3> Fun Facts </h3>
   <p>I have 5 memebers in my family my dad, mom, 2 sisters and me. My dad and mom are both from Ecuador and my 2 sisters and I were born here. Which makes us Ecuadorian and American. One of my sister is a todler she's 1 year old almost 2 (yay!) and the other one is 10 years old. I am the oldest which sucks because I have to look after them every day. I hate baby sitting the middle one her name is sheyla she always likes me to get annoyed. She's a real pain but the little one, she loves me more than sheyla. Sheyla bothers her a lot and she doesn't like that. Her name is sasha me and her get along so well :)   </p>
