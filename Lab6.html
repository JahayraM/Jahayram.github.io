<p >Some of you may know him as Santa but the modern character of Santa Claus is Saint Nicholas. Saint Nicholas was a Christian bishop who helped those in need. After his death, the legend of his gift-giving grew. Saint Nicholas transformed into the legendary character called Santa Claus, who brings Christmas presents to children around the world. The story of Santa Claus is said to live at the North Pole with his wife, where he spends the year making toys with the help of his elves. There he receives letters from children asking for Christmas gifts. On Christmas Eve he loads his sleigh with toys and flies around the world, drawn by eight reindeer, stopping at each child’s house; he slides down the chimney and leaves the gifts, refreshing himself with the milk and cookies left for him by the household’s children. </p>

<p >We all have heard either the story, song, or movie of rudolph with the red nosed reindeer. Well those who dont know, Robert L. May. created this character. And Johnny Marks created the origonal music of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer". The story of Rudolph started off with his characteristics. Rudolph was abnormally large, shiny, and had a red nose. He was constantly teased by the other black-nosed reindeer. Rudolph was very upset and hated his nose. But on a foggy Christmas Eve, Santa realizes Rudolph's glowing snout is what he needs so that he can deliver presents to children on time. Ever since that day he has learned to love himself even though he is different and every raindeer respected him as leader. Rudolph basically saved christmas!
