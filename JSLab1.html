<p> One day, while the sun descended beyond the horizon, the Sun noticed something unusual—a little <span id = "name1">____</span> named <span id = "name2"> ____</span>, was at the edge of a mountain.

Curious, the Sun approached and asked. "Why are you here?" in a soft voice.

<span id = "name2"></span> replied "I’ve have been always waiting, wondering if I would be noticed."

The Sun was surprised and replied. "You’re waiting for me? But I give light to the entire world every day!"

<span id = "name2"></span> replied: "It’s not just light that I seek. It’s your warmth and your kindness."
The Sun was shooked as he never expected such response and from that day forward, the Sun would rise but this time with a new purpose: like the one it had with the little <span id = "name1"></span>. And in return, the sun has never felt lonely again. 
	The End<3

	One day the two of them went up a hill and found a pot of <span id = "noun1"> _____</span>. But then a <span id = "name3">____</span> came up to them and was very mad so they quickly ran away. And that's when they saw their friend <span id = "name4">____</span>. But their friend was on the other side of where they were, so they used a magical <span id = "name5">____</span>. Which help them get across to see their friend. They went on to go for an advanture but hours later they realized they were lost. Thats when <span id = "name6">____</span> appeared and helped them find their way to go home. But their worst enemy, <span id = "name7">____</span> tries to kill them all. That's when <span id = "name8">____</span> steps in and helps them defeat the enemy. They had a blast and thought they should meet up again in <span id = "name9">____</span>. On a <span id = "name10">____</span> to hang put.
