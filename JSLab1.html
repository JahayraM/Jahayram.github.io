	<h3>MadLib - This the assignment</h3>

<!-- Extend the Madlib so that it has at least 8 different words-->
<p> Here's a madlib about a kid named <span id = "name1">____</span>  who had an imaginary friend <span id = "name2"> ____</span>. One day the two of them went up a hill and found a pot of <span id = "noun1"> _____</span>.

But then a <span id = "name3">____</span> came up to them and was very mad so they quickly ran away. And that's when they saw their friend <span id = "name4">____</span>. But their friend was on the other side of where they were, so they used a magical <span id = "name5">____</span>. Which help them get across to see their friend. They went on to go for an advanture but hours later they realized they were lost. Thats when <span id = "name6">____</span> appeared and helped them find their way to go home. But their worst enemy, <span id = "name7">____</span> tries to kill them all. That's when <span id = "name8">____</span> steps in and helps them defeat the enemy. They had a blast and thought they should meet up again in <span id = "name9">____</span>. On a <span id = "name10">____</span> to hang put.
