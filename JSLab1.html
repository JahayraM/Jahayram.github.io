    <p>One day, while the sun descended beyond the horizon, the Sun noticed something unusual—a little <span id="name1">____</span> named <span id="name2">____</span>, was at the edge of a mountain. 

    Curious, the Sun approached and asked, "Why are you here?" in a soft voice. 

    <span id="name2Repeat"></span> replied, "I’ve always been waiting, wondering if I would be noticed." 

    The Sun was surprised and replied, "You’re waiting for me? But I give light to the entire world every day!" 

    <span id="name2Repeat2"></span> replied: "It’s not just light that I seek. It’s your warmth and your kindness."

    The Sun was shocked, as it had never expected such a response. And from that day forward, the Sun would rise, but this time with a new purpose: like the one it had with the little <span id="name1Repeat"></span>. And in return, the Sun has never felt lonely again. 

    The End <3

	One day the two of them went up a hill and found a pot of <span id = "noun1"> _____</span>. But then a <span id = "name3">____</span> came up to them and was very mad so they quickly ran away. And that's when they saw their friend <span id = "name4">____</span>. But their friend was on the other side of where they were, so they used a magical <span id = "name5">____</span>. Which help them get across to see their friend. They went on to go for an advanture but hours later they realized they were lost. Thats when <span id = "name6">____</span> appeared and helped them find their way to go home. But their worst enemy, <span id = "name7">____</span> tries to kill them all. That's when <span id = "name8">____</span> steps in and helps them defeat the enemy. They had a blast and thought they should meet up again in <span id = "name9">____</span>. On a <span id = "name10">____</span> to hang put.
