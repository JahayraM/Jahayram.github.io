<p>For this assignment I had to pick out 3 creatures and put them together making a mythical creature which turned out to be cool. As you can see above, they are about to battle one another for territories. I created this image by combining the animals I like and to what would look good together. The one on the left has the ability to fly, is quick, and has very sharp teeth like big knives. The one on the right could fly, and shoot small  bits of water and fire out of their mouth, has very sharp claws and a powerful heavy tail. As you can see, it is also huge and heavier than the other creature. And I used an app called Adobe photoshop to help create these creatures into one. Who do you think will win?<p>
