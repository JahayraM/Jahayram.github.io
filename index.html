    <p style="color: brown; font-family: cursive;">"Believe you can and you're halfway there" - Theodore Roosevelt</p>
    <center><p> My name is Jahayra Maldonado, and I take pride in my Ecuadorian roots as part of a proud Hispanic household. Growing up in The Bronx, I developed a deep appreciation for hard work, resilience, and authenticity—values my parents instilled in me from an early age. Their inspiring migration journey shaped my mindset and fueled my ambition to succeed. In middle school, I realized the importance of education as a path to support my parents and siblings. This drive led me to prioritize my studies, dedicating after-school hours to revision rather than spending time with friends. That mindset shift made a significant difference in my academic journey. One of the most valuable lessons I've learned is to reflect on failures—not as setbacks but as opportunities to grow by finding new approaches rather than repeating old ones. <br><br>

As the eldest sibling in a Hispanic household, I naturally took on the role of a role model and had to mature early. From caring for my siblings to managing responsibilities independently, I learned the importance of adaptability. Since my parents spoke limited English when I was growing up, I had to navigate many challenges on my own. From reading and writing english with tutors, to applying to colleges, to making many life changing decisions. Being a first-generation college student has been a journey filled with challenges and growth. My evolving mindset and determination are why I am where I am today. If I hadn’t changed my way of thinking, I might not have pursued higher education or realized my full potential.
<br> 
<br>I have played soccer since middle school which has grown into a hobby of mine. It’s incredible how one can learn a lot of values based on a sport. I have learned teamwork, leadership, self control, self motivation, and lastly being able to work underpressure. I understand and have been in the position multiple times of being underpressue, it can be emotionally and sometimes physically exhausting. But thats where your motivation and ambitions come in to carry you throughout the game. </center></p>

    <!---------About me page------->
  <br>
    <p style="color: black; "> I have a passion for coding and a strong dedication to learning. I attended Bronx Early College Academy, graduating a month early, which allowed me to get a head start by taking college courses at Lehman College and Arizona State University. Currently, I'm pursuing a degree in Business Administration at Mercy University on the Westchester campus, where I plan to complete both my undergraduate and master's degrees.
As a junior, I've been recognized by friends, family, and coworkers for being dependable, proactive, considerate, and always eager to learn. I'm excited about the journey ahead and grateful that you took the time to learn a bit more about me!</p>
