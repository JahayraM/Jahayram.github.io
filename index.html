    <center><p> My name is Jahayra Maldonado, I come from a Hispanic household and take pride in my Ecuadorian roots. I was born and raised in the Bronx. Where different cultures blend and shape one another. My parents have taught me the importance of hard work, determination, and staying true to oneself, no matter the challenges life throws your way. Their story of migration is truly inspirational, and it has shaped my mindset in ways that set me apart from other kids. It opened my eyes in middle school to have a lifestyle where I can support my parents and siblings, which fueled my ambition towards my studies. I began focused more on my grades, dedicating afterschool hours to revision instead of hanging out with my friends. The realization has made my grades a significant change. Something that I have learned in life so far is reflecting on your failures, because from those errors you will be one step ahead then you were from the start. Knowing not to repeat the same methods but to find another way.
As an older sister of a hispanic household i am seen as a role model and had to mature at an early age. To taking care of my siblings and depending on myself since I was little. Since my parents at the time they had me knew very little english. Learning and adapting was one of my skills I grew up with. To applying colleges and figuring out my life and what would be better and not better for me was a challenge as I am also a first gen of my family to attend and will complete my studies. My values and mindset have definitely evolved over time and is the reason as to why i am, where i am at today. If I haden’t changed my ways of thinking I probably would have not entered college or had the opportunity to realize my full potential. 
I have played soccer since middle school which has grown into a hobby of mine. It’s incredible how one can learn a lot of values based on a sport. I have learned teamwork, leadership, self control, self motivation, and lastly being able to work underpressure. I understand and have been in the position multiple times of being underpressue, it can be emotionally and sometimes physically exhausting. But thats where your motivation and ambitions come in to carry you through.
